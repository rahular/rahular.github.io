title: Hello, world!

Hello, world! I started my Ph.D at the University of Copenhagen recently. I will be working on multi-lingual semantic parsing. Therefore I have decided to restart my blog with posts related to my work. My aim is to this make this a high-quality NLP blog. If you still want to read my old posts (which were about a varying range of topics like Android, basic Deep Learning, etc.), you can find them <a href="https://github.com/rahular/rahular.github.io/tree/master/old_posts" target="_blank">here</a>.
